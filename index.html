                    The Kitchen is full of many great appliances to help you with cooking. The <strong>Stove</strong> and <strong>Oven</strong> are probably the most essential for the kind of food that will be discussed on this site. A Wok would definitely be handy but by no means mandatory. The Appliances are not the only thing you'll need! Make sure you've got a good selection of kitchenware tools like a <strong>spatula</strong> and <strong>tongs</strong>, there are a few dishes that may require more but your in a flat, you've sometimes go to make do with what you have. So don't sweat it if you haven't got anything else. <strong>Bowls</strong> and <strong>Plates</strong> are essential though so make sure you've got some clean ones before you start cooking. Oh and remember <strong>knifes and forks</strong>, your flat mates will most likely enjoy the use of those.

                <p>Here is some information about each person in this flat, each has a different dynamic and style of cooking. They have some helpful advice and insight into cooking from different angles.</p>

                <h2><strong>Joseph</strong> The Double Carb</h2>

                <p>
                Joseph is a fan of hearty carb-filled meals, with meals ranging from mashed potato on focaccia bread to spaghetti bolognese with extra parmesan. He comes from a farming background so his enthusiasm for game meats is inspiring. On occasions he will treat the flat to beef mince from his own farm in the rich farming area of Havelock North in the Hawkes Bay Gulf. His meals are always seasoned to perfection due to his history in the culinary arts in cafes and restaurants across the North Island (currently working at the Verve Cafe on Lambton Quay). The base ideas for his meals come from the convenient Pantry Check Method (simply evaluating the current ingredient selection in the kitchen). These idea's are heightened by his knowledge of cuisine and with the simple rule of thumb; don't forget your seasonings.

                <h2><strong>Donaldson</strong> The Hit and Miss</h2>
                <p>Donaldson is known for pushing the boundaries of culinary perfection, though it comes with the price of being very inconsistent. He is inspired by his favorite chef of all time Gordon Ramsay. He has acquired a range of skills from idol. Coming from South Africa, he can't get enough of his spices creating an authentic taste with nearly every meal. A chicken lover on most nights, he will make anything from a Chicken Korma to Roast Chicken. He recently picked up a slow cooker and with this he continues to amaze. Slow cookers are great for anyone who is organized and time-efficient. A food enthusiast at the worst of times, Donaldson provides the rule of thumb "always cook with fresh ingredients".  </p>

                <p>Scott is a very efficient cook, he discovers and creates meals that have 0% chance of going wrong. Meals such as stir fries, fried rice and gourmet sausage sizzles play are some of his preferred meals to cook. He comes from a beach culture and his meals often have summery feel to them, his tools of choice are the Wok or the BBQ. Generally you'll see a great ratio of vegetables to meat to carbs throughout his dishes. He always leaves the flat mates full and satisfied after each meal. His rule of thumb is: "if its fast and fulling you'll have happy customers".</p>

His meals are rich in spices and use mainly noodles or rice to ground them.

                <h2>Working Together</h2>
                <p>Sometimes it can be hard adapting to cooking for larger audiences, but the key is the more the merrier. Though in saying that you do not want to be buying twice as much as need, price is important especially when you are in a flat full of students. This is around 250gm of mince per person in most of the meals the flat eats. Remember to communicate with each other about what meals you are going to or want to cook. This will help you avoid eating chicken carbonara for the whole week. </p>
